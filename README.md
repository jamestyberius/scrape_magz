This project uses Beautiful Soup to login to a specific magazine's website and download an archive of back-issue PDFs.

Note that a valid, paid subscription to the magazine is required. This automates the download of the entire archive and eliminates the need to manually navigate and download each issue. The issue archive is a perk of subscription so nothing nefarious is occurring here. Credentials are passed in a config file not committed here.

This code worked in 2022 but I cannot guarantee it still works, as my subscription has since lapsed.

May eventually expand this to work for other magazines' archives if and when I subscribe to them :-p
